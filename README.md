# Using Linked List vs Array for implementing Queue and Stack

Array advantages:
- Random access which means fast search time
- Less memory needed per element

Array disadvantages: 
- Slow insertion/deletion time
- it has fixed size
- Inefficient memory allocation

Linked List advantages: 
- Fast insertion/deletion time
- Dynamic size
- Efficient memory allocation

Linked List disadvantages:
- Slow search time
- More memory needed for storing pointers
